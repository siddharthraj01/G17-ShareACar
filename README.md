EASY RIDE HAS TWO VISION:
1.	CARPOOLING
2.	CAR RENTAL

CARPOOLING :-
Carpooling is when two or more people share private cars for transport. The US has set up High-Occupancy Toll lanes or HOT lanes. This practice is to reserve lanes on selected roads and highways for vehicles with more than one person. This restricts single-occupancy vehicles to the other lanes. By relaxing speed limits on these lanes as well, HOT lanes become relatively faster. It has been effectively set up in China and Indonesia. It encouraged commuters to choose carpool for a faster and cheaper journey.

 

Critics believe that India’s particular disregard for lane-driving would make HOT lanes ineffective. But effective implementation would foster a strong incentive for disciplined driving culture. However, imposing large fines on violators in HOT lanes with strict monitoring in limited areas can incentivise passengers to carpool.
 
Carpooling will not just bring down gas expenditure but also make travelling a lot more fun. By rotating driving responsibilities each day, you can save yourself from fatigue too. More often than not, 5 people driving the same route to work will use their own cars. But switch to that one car for faster, fun, and pocket-friendly travel to work.

CAR RENTAL
A car rental, hire car or car hire agency is a company that rents automobiles for short periods of time to the public, generally ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. It is often organized with numerous local branches (which allow a user to return a vehicle to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy city areas and often complemented by a website allowing online reservations.
 

Car rental agencies primarily serve people who require a temporary vehicle, for example, those who do not own their own car, travelers who are out of town, or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Car rental agencies may also serve the self-moving industry needs, by renting vans or trucks, and in certain markets, other types of vehicles such as motorcycles or scooters may also be offered.

Alongside the basic rental of a vehicle, car rental agencies typically also offer extra products such as insurance, global positioning system (GPS) navigation systems, entertainment systems, mobile phones, portable WiFi and child safety seats.


SURVEY RESULT :-

Carpooling:
•	Environmentally friendly: Many people view carpooling as an eco-friendly transportation option that reduces the number of vehicles on the road, resulting in decreased traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions.
•	Cost savings: Carpooling allows participants to share the costs of fuel and tolls, reducing individual transportation expenses.
•	Social interaction: Carpooling provides an opportunity for people to socialize and interact with others during their commute, potentially leading to new connections and networking opportunities.
•	Time efficiency: Carpooling can help minimize the time spent in traffic, as shared rides often make use of carpool lanes or take advantage of optimized routes.
•	Concerns about safety and compatibility: Some individuals may have concerns about safety, trusting strangers, or finding compatible carpool partners with similar schedules and preferences.
Car Rental:
•	Flexibility: Car rental offers flexibility and convenience, allowing individuals to access a vehicle when needed without the responsibilities and costs associated with car ownership.
•	Travel and exploration: Renting a car is often associated with vacations or travel, providing the freedom to explore new places and destinations.
•	Temporary vehicle replacement: Car rental can serve as a temporary replacement when a personal vehicle is undergoing repairs or maintenance.
•	Variety of vehicle options: Car rental companies offer a range of vehicles, allowing individuals to choose the type and size of the car that suits their specific needs and preferences.

 
•	Concerns about cost and rental process: Some people may find car rental expensive, especially during peak seasons or in high-demand areas. Additionally, concerns about the rental process, such as paperwork, insurance, and deposit requirements, can be perceived as barriers.

FUTURE SCOPE OF CARPOOLING AND CAR RENTAL

The future scope of carpooling and car rental holds great potential, as both concepts align with the evolving transportation landscape and changing consumer preferences. Here are some potential developments and synergies that may shape the future of carpooling and car rental:

1.	Shared autonomous vehicles: The emergence of autonomous vehicles presents an exciting opportunity for both carpooling and car rental. Shared autonomous vehicles could be used for both carpooling purposes, where passengers with similar routes are grouped together, and individual rentals, enabling users to conveniently access self-driving cars for their transportation needs.
2.	Dynamic pricing and incentives: Future platforms could implement dynamic pricing models that incentivize users to participate in carpooling or opt for certain rental options during off-peak hours or periods of high demand. Additionally, incentives such as loyalty programs, discounts, or rewards can be offered to encourage users to engage in sustainable and shared transportation practices.
3.	Enhanced user experiences: Carpooling and car rental services can focus on enhancing the user experience
4.	through advanced technologies. This may include seamless mobile applications for booking and managing rides/rentals, personalized recommendations based on user preferences, real-time updates on vehicle availability, and integrated payment systems for a smooth and hassle-free experience.
5.	Multi-modal integration: Future platforms can integrate carpooling and car rental with other transportation modes, such as public transit, bike-sharing, or scooter-sharing. This would provide users with a seamless and interconnected network of mobility options, allowing them to easily transition between different modes for efficient and sustainable travel.
6.	Sustainability and environmental impact: Both carpooling and car rental services can prioritize sustainability and environmental impact reduction. This can be achieved by incorporating electric or hybrid vehicles into their fleets, encouraging carpooling to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, and implementing eco-friendly practices in vehicle maintenance and operations.
